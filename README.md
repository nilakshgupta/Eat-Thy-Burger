# Eat-Thy-Burger
A full stack  web app featuring the use of Node, Express server, Handlebars for view generation and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL.

Eat-Thy-Burger app lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
